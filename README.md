# A Propos - Talking about me
20 y/o French software engineer | Last year MSc @Centrale Nantes, Computer Science and Management.\
I love working on differents aspects of software development.

I already worked as a freelance product owner on Junior Entreprise contracts, \
ranging from custom CMS to SaaS products (Laravel, VueJS, NodeJS, Python).

I have worked with multiple tools to build my own projects :\
Java + Spring Boot for RESTful APIs, Python for problem solving, VueJS + NodeJS for web fullstack.
